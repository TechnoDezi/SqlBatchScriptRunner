# Sql Batch Script Runner
Sql Batch script runner is a general purpose MS Sql script runner that can process multiple batch sql files and run them against your database.

This tool is a perfect free alternative to the Red-Gate SQL Multi Script.

Sql script runner allows you to select a folder containing multiple batch scripts. Change your connection string and run all the scripts against the database.

After all scripts have been run, you can view a log of all the errors, or export the entire message log to file.
